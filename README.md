<h5>Introduction</h5>
___
* This document details the merchant's <b>Android App</b> integration with Citrus Payment gateway.There is a difference between <b>Normal(PG) Payment</b> and <b>Wallet Payment</b>!
* <b>Normal</b> payment requires only <b>email</b> and <b>mobile</b>. Citrus User account will be created by using only mobile or both email & mobile number combination. We call it as <b><i>Limited Access</i></b>. Once user is logged in with Limited Access, card can be saved against his account, saved cards can be fetched against his account.
* <b>Wallet</b> Payment requires the user to be logged in with <b><i>Full Access </i></b>. Once the user is logged in with  <b><i>Full Access </i></b> the user can pay using his wallet balance as well saved cards in the account.

This is enhanced [version](docs/Version%20History.md) of SDK V2 wherein you can implement your App with features such as:

* Unified Login Api with native login screen
* Pay using Credit Card/Debit Card & Netbanking 
* Pay Using Citrus Cash - user can make a payment using Citrus Cash account if he has sufficient amount for payment. 
* Get Citrus Cash balance
* Load Money – money can be loaded to user’s account using CC/DC/NB option.
* Save Cards and Bank options to user account for faster checkout
* Fetch Saved cards of user
* Delete Cards
* Send Money
* Withdraw your Money
